# plugin.video.mixer
Incredibly simplistic Mixer Livestreaming Addon for Kodi
Tested on Kodi 18.3 and whatever version is running on my raspberry pi.

Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/Caliaha/plugin.video.mixer/releases/).
After starting up Kodi, go to Addons -> Install from zip file.  You may have to
enable unknown sources before you can install it.
